# Take a string as input for a name and a string for course number and outputs a welcome message.
# For example: if the input name is “Jane” and the course name is “CS 1030”, the output is: “Welcome, Jane, to course CS 1030!” 

# Take a string as input, say input_string, then print the first 2 and the last 2 characters in the string. 
#  Assume the input string is 2 or more characters. The print should look like:
#   “The first 2 characters are: ”the first 2
#   “The last  2 characters are: ” the last 2
